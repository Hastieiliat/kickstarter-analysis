- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When the goals are small amount (<1000) there is a big successful amount in the projects but for the highest goal (>50000) we have the biggest failure. In three points the percentage of failure and success are the same. These points are when the goals are between (15000 to 19999), (35000 to 39999)and (40000 to 449999).
